# CPS406-MQIX
## Project Details
This project is a simplified recreation of the classic arcade game Qix. The player navigates a marker along the edges of a square field and draws incursions inward to claim territory, all while avoiding two types of enemies: the wandering Qix and the edge-travelling Sparx. Each successful incursion reduces the enemyâ€™s roaming area, but getting caught during an unfinished push results in losing life force and cancelling progress. The objective is to claim a predefined percentage of the field and advance through increasingly challenging levels.
